Simple and compact userChrome for Firefox. Made for people that love having many tabs and keyboard-based efficient programs.

This theme requires you to activate the compact theme, which can be done through `Customize > Density (bottom left) > Compact`.

The tutorial for installing a userChrome can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/).

I recommend using the Ctrl-L hotkey to highlight the urlbar.
